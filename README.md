# About
OneBite is an app which provides courses from e-learning platforms like Duolingo and Udemy. Users can also schedule their lessons with Google Calendar.OneBite has follow function so users can compete with friends after following each other.

# Future features
1 The number of courses is limited at the moment so I will try to add more

2 Google Calendar does not allow the users to add events so I am going to add simple calendar form to create an enrollment

3 I will add mobile responsiveness

# Note
Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
